title: "Design Decisions for 0.5 Milestone"

I really want to get the Workbench to a point that it can be used by real people on real problems. And I would like that to happen as soon as possible, preferably by the end of 2018.

This post is my attempt to decide what I need to do to get the project to the point where it can be used in anger. Plainly the project isn't going to be completed, but at least I can begin to receive real feedback about it and improve from there.

## What does the output from the Workbench look like?
