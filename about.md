Jack has been doing the rounds in the I.T. industry since 1992 after an illustrious career as a washer upper, gardener & construction labourer.

Most of Jackâ€™s career in I.T. has been spent at the code face writing a variety of Microsoft Windows software using C/C++, including a stint writing network management software. He even had a spell writing device drivers for a range of long defunct ISDN cards. He did manage to reach one of his life goals by getting a product he worked on into his local PC World store. (He also saw the same product in the remainder bin not too long afterwards.)

Jack now does lots of different tasks including stints of programming, inbound marketing, e-commerce and office cleaner. Most of his time is dedicated to helping run OPENXTRA Ltd., a specialist IT reseller / distributor.

This blog will mostly talk about Jack's software development activities including his current side project building a [constraint satisfaction workbench](https://github.com/digitalbricklayer/workbench) everybody can use... well not at the moment because I haven't finished it yet.

If you want to read my (now defunct) ramblings about network management and the like, please visit the [Tech Teapot blog](https://techteapot.com/).

Cheers,

Jack Hughes
